# Foxo Integration API
Docs on using the Foxo integration API

API Endpoints can be created in your Foxo account under Profile > Settings > Integrations. Endpoints created are unique to your account and carry authentication thus should be shared with care.

Testing the API can be done by creating an account on our staging server [app-staging.foxo.com](https://app-staging.foxo.com).

## Postman Demo
Covers the core patient workflows.

## Basics
Since there is a single endpoint actions are determined by method and `X-Foxo-Action`.

A version header may be passed (`X-Foxo-Version`) but is ignored for now, since we will aim to be as backwards compatible as possible with all changes to the api.
